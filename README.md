Understanding Expectations and Privacy Implications in Image Based Dietary Assessment: The Diyetim Dataset
## Repository details

### Abstract
The field of dietary assessment currently lacks empirical evidence on what will be considered as privacy violations in exploring trends in long running studies. 
Such studies are increasingly asking their cohorts to use images of food items as a log of their dietary intake.
This new technology adds further complexity to the question of privacy.   
However, prior works have only classified images as private or public depending on the basic content of the images.  
We conducted an online study (n=105) to investigate common perceptions of systems using food images for dietary assessment.
We present the *Diyetim* dataset. 
The dataset contains expectations, issues and data sharing preferences of dietary data for such long running studies.

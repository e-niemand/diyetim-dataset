Imagine yourself as an athlete representing an elite club in your country. Your contract with the club mandates that you take pictures of your dietary
intake via an app, whenever you are eating. This includes breakfast, lunch and other meals including snacks and drinks at events. **Even for private
events when you are not training**, you are required to take pictures of your food intake. All this recording is done via a mobile application (app). The
app allows your club owner, manager, coach and doctor to monitor your diet plan and offer recommendations. The app takes your individual food
intake pictures and stores it online.
For the following set of questions, indicate your response on a scale of strong disagreement to strong agreement.

**5 point Likert scale** : Strongly Disagree / Disagree / Neutral / Agree / Strongly Agree

Imagine a scenario in which you took picture of everything you consumed in last one year.

The third-party has access to enormous computing infrastructure, employs machine learning methods and can use publicly available data from the internet.

In your opinion, do you think it is possible to figure out the following based on your diet data.
